        <p>This portfolio summarizes my approach to engineering design with examples from my first year of engineering at the University of Toronto. I cover: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>an improved beehive made for Praxis II</li>
          <li>a matboard bridge for CIV102</li>
          <li>back posture corrector made for Praxis I</li>
          <li>small miscellaneous projects where I applied my learnings from Praxis I and II</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
        in addition to my position on engineering design.

        <h2>My Position</h2>
        <p>
        Engineering design is the process of analyzing a problem that affects stakeholders, and designing and building a solution to this problem. The solution ideally addresses all stakeholder concerns. The premise of "good" and "great"<label for="f1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="f1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">I consider a "bad" design to be one that does not meet key stakeholder concerns. A "good" design meets stakeholder requirements.  </span> designs is informed by my values of  <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">attention to detail</span> and <span style="font-variant: small-caps">curiosity</span>.


        <h3>Attention to detail</h3>
        <p>
        I value spending (sometimes excessive) time on every small detail. This value originates from my parents who do the same, and usually leads to a high quality final product. However, I found this to be counterproductive to the engineering design process especially while diverging. 
        
        The goal of diverging is to generate as many ideas to broadly explore the design space. Prototypes are meant to be low-fidelity, and my attention to detail sometimes meant I spent too much energy on ideas that ended up being scrapped. I am learning that scrappy work is permissible for early stages of the design process, where the goal is to broadly explore the solution space to an engineering problem.
        </p>
        <h3>Curiosity</h3>
        <p>
        I think I can learn anything, and nothing is too hard if someone else has done it before (even if, learning something is indeed hard). This generally means I am open to learning things outside my <em>proximal zone of development</em><label for="f2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="f2" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Proximal zone of development describes a task that is just beyond someone's current abilities. It was introduced in Praxis II</span> and approach engineering tasks where I have no expertise in. This also means I may fail when attempting certain engineering tasks because I do not know where to start working. 
        </p>  
        <hr>
        <p>
        These values have helped me be a different type of thinker that can help push out unconventional ideas. I used to be afraid to share these ideas because I thought they were silly and did not want to waste my team's time. I am more open to sharing now that I realize (i) laughing at my silly designs is nothing to be afraid of (in fact, in can be fun!) and (ii) seemingly silly ideas may be worth pursuing. <b>talk about learning to be more balanced?</b>

        <h2 id="praxisII">Designing an Accessible Beehive</h2>
        <p>
        Peter Leong, Ghazala Singh, Ellie Kim, and I decided to design a more accessible beehive for the Toronto Beekeepers Collective. Currently, they use Langstroth hives which require lifting heavy 40-kg boxes in order to access the frames containing honey. This can lead to injury.

        Our goals was to reduce the force required to access frames of honey. Our solution is drawer-style hive that uses male-female drawer slide connection. We could not use traditional drawer slides since bees secrete a glue-like substance, called propolis, which would clog drawer slides. Our design avoids having gaps bees can propolize. 

        Our design is summarized below.
